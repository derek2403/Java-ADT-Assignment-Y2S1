- **Backend**: Java Spring Boot application
- **Frontend**: Next application

## Prerequisites

- Java 11 or higher
- Maven 3.6 or higher
- Node.js 14.x or higher

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### Backend

1. **Navigate to the Backend Directory**

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Make sure you have Maven installed. If not, install it from [Maven's official site](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).

3. **Run the Application**

   Use Maven to run the application in development mode:

   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=dev
   ```

   This command starts the backend application. The backend will be accessible at `http://localhost:8080` (or the port specified in your application configuration).

### Frontend

1. **Navigate to the Frontend Directory**

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. If not, install them from [Node.js's official site](https://nodejs.org/).

   Install the frontend dependencies using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Application**

   Start the frontend development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This command starts the frontend application. The frontend will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in your `package.json` configuration).

## Usage

- **Backend API Endpoints**: Refer to the backend controllers for available API endpoints and their usage.
- **Frontend Interface**: The React application provides a user interface for interacting with the backend services.
